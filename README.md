# Binary Tree Optimization 

Code for when I participated in research over the summer with the goal to optomize research through memoization and tabulation.
This is written in C++, and was done under the Math and Computer Science department at York College.

The results was presented at the NSF national conference in Washington DC over over the spring break in 2023.

Most of the code was done individually but other implementations required additional tools such as stackoverflow and Chat-GPT

**Thank you**
